### Prerequisites

- To use the git command, you need to have git installed, you can do this by installing it through [git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com)
- You also need a text editor to enjoy your code editing. I personally recommend [VS Code](http://code.visualstudio.com)
- And the latest version of Mozilla, Chrome or Edge browser to see it work.


### Getting Help and Guides

- To get Started using Materializecss, A very good and the only resource I recommend is the documentation provided on [Materializecss website](http://materializecss.com)
- Get previews and choose the icon of your choice at [ionicons website](http://ionicons.com) and [ionicons official cheat-sheet](http://ionicons.com/cheatsheet.html)
- [Fontawesome.io](http://fontawesome.io/) is a very good place to check out font-awesome icons and [cheatsheets](http://fontawesome.io/cheatsheet/)
- See Animatecss( A library for using css animation on our page) demos [here](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) or Animatecss [github repo](http://github.com/daneden/animate.css)

### Why use Ionicons and Fontawesome in the same Project?

Good Question! Ionicons is a library that offers elegant and brilliant icons but don't have much icons as fontawesome do. So you could choose to use any of the great icons in both ionicons or font-awesome. This gives you more flexibility.
**Below is a snippet on how to an icon from the ionicons library.**
```
<i class="icon ion-bookmark"></i>
```
**And this for a sample font-awesome icon**
```
<i class="fa fa-plus"></i>
```
